# Analysing-Carbon-Emissions-with-SQL
To identify which industries and products contribute the most to global emissions and analyze their emissions intensity based on weight and production stage.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes over 1,000 records of Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) with the following key fields:

product_name, company, country, industry_group

weight_kg – Weight of the product

carbon_footprint_pcf – Total emissions in kg CO₂e

upstream_percent_total_pcf, operations_percent_total_pcf, downstream_percent_total_pcf – Emission distribution across the supply chain

🔧 Steps Performed
Data Upload – Imported .csv file into MySQL using Workbench

Data Cleaning – Removed invalid rows, handled missing values, and converted percentage columns from text to float

Normalization – Renamed and restructured columns for clarity and precision

Aggregation & Analysis – Used SQL to summarize emissions by:

Industry group

Product type

Country of origin

Emissions per kg

Life cycle stage distribution
